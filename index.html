                Design Constraints: <br>
                 The device had to be light enough to use, easily learned and affordable.

                Design Process:<br>
                Throughout the entire project, I led my teammates towards our common goal. Most of the work was done through AutoDesk's Inventor, allowing us to 3D model the parts  prior to manufact[...]
